fix equation (67)
use ietf_verify to get the output hash of Hv
use that to create posterior entropy_pool.current


6.7:
- validate length of ticket extrinsic- (as importer) bubble up error if wrong Formula 75
- validate set of new ticket bubble up error if wrong order (as importer) formulas  76 -> 78
- construct posterior ticket accumelator formula 79
- vaidate that all tickets were used - Fomrula 80

Disputes, Verdicts and Judgements
- clear any work-reports which we judged as uncertain or invalid from their core Formula (111)

- Validate the block header(importer) - bubble error if not. Formula 116, 117 
- fix: currently the node does work to order and uniqe the incoming vercits extrnsics
       I believe this is wrong. 
       a. as an importer, if the extrnsic is not proper (ordered and unique) bubble error up (reject block)
	b. as an author, should place the extrnsics in the correct manner
	
Reporting and Assurance

- Formula (120) a block that will cause  a write to state of a too large work-report shold be rejected (bubble up erro)
- Assurance extrinsic
	- define the struct
	- (importer) validate and bubble error
		- length of extrinsic (Formula 125)
		- anchor on parent hash (Formula 126)
		- order Formula (127)
		- valid signature (128)
		- valid bits (130)
- Availaibly reports
	- construct the series of available work-reports W (131)
	- use it to constrcut ρ‡ (132)
- Guarantor Assignments
    - make Φ function, Formula (59) more available (currentl is under rotate keys)
    - implement rotation function R (Formula 134)
    - implement The Fisher-Yates shuffle function (Appendix F, Formulas 306 ->308)
    - depends on R and F (shuffle)  - implement permute function P (Formula 135)
    - depends on P and Φ - build G (Formula 136)
    - build G* (Formula 137)

- Work Report Guarantees extrinsic
    - right now Block.Extrinsic.unique_sorted_guarantees "cleans up" the guarantees for down 
        stream processing. This is wrong. instead it is the author's job to make sure the guarantees are
        in the correct order and unique. As an importer, if the guarantees are not in the correct order and unique
        bubble up an error.
        - validate length of extrinsic (Formula 138)
        - validate order by core index (Formula 139)
        - validate order + unique by validator index (Formula 140)
        - validate signature (Formula 141)
        - validate signing validator assigned core index (Formula 141)
        - validate relationship with core Assignments ρ++ and authorizer pool (Formula 144)
        - validate gas (Formula 145)
        - validate no duplicate work-package hashes (Formula 146, 147)
        - validate anchor block  (Formula 148)
        - validate lookup-anchor block (Formula 149)
        - validate record (Formula 150)
        - validate work-package not appear in our recent history (Formula 151)
        - validate prerequisite work-package (Formula 152)
        - validate correct code-hash (Formula 153)
