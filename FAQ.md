# FAQ

1. What is Jamixir?
Jamixir is an initiative to implement the JAM protocol using the Elixir programming language. The project aims to explore how JAM, a novel protocol, can be applied using Elixir's unique strengths, particularly in asynchronous and I/O-bound systems.

2. What is the JAM protocol?
The JAM protocol is a framework designed for composable blockchain interactions, primarily within the Polkadot ecosystem. It's an advanced concept meant to enhance scalability and interoperability across different blockchain networks. You can read the [official gray paper](https://graypaper.com) to understand the technical details.

3. Why was Elixir chosen for JAM?
Elixir was selected for several reasons:
 - Experience: The Jamixir team has strong experience in Elixir.
 - Productivity: Elixir’s expressiveness and performance in handling concurrent I/O-bound operations make it a strong candidate for the JAM implementation.
 - Ecosystem: Elixir's mature ecosystem, including its use of the Erlang VM (BEAM), offers high reliability for building scalable, fault-tolerant applications.

4. How can I contribute to Jamixir?
We are always looking for developers and contributors who are passionate about Elixir, JAM, and blockchain technology. You can help by:

 - Contributing to the codebase on GitHub: [Jamixir Repo](https://github.com/jamixir/jamixir)
 - Participating in discussions and offering feedback on the development process.
 - Helping with documentation and tutorials to onboard other contributors.
 
5. What is the current state of the project?
Currently, the project is in the early stages. The team is actively researching the JAM protocol and developing the initial implementation in Elixir. You can track progress and access learning resources on this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjGN96vX3BTKjLfBd5LimBuDuch-QfKPy).

6. Is there a roadmap for Jamixir?
Yes! The roadmap is divided into 5 millestones:
 - 0.1 - **IMPORTER**: State-transitioning conformance tests pass and can import blocks. 
   - 0.1.1 - Block/header data structures and serialization [x]
   - 0.1.2 - State data structures and serialization [x]
   - 0.1.3 - In-memory DB and Merklization [ ]
   - 0.1.4 - Non-PVM block execution/state-transition [ ]
   - 0.1.6 - Block-import tests [ ]
 - 0.2 - **AUTHOR**: Fully conformant and can produce blocks (including networking, off-chain). [ ]
 - 0.5 - **HALF-SPEED**: Conformance and Kusama-level performance (including PVM implementation). [ ]
 - 0.9 - **FULL-SPEED**: Conformance and Polkadot-level performance (including PVM implementation). [ ]
 - 1.0 - **SECURE**: Fully audited. [ ]

7. How can I stay updated on Jamixir’s progress?

 - Subscribe to the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjGN96vX3BTKjLfBd5LimBuDuch-QfKPy) for videos related to our progress and JAM protocol discussions.

8. Is there a deadline or time limit for the JAM implementation?
There is no official deadline, but we aim to complete the implementation within 1 to 2 years. The goal is to align with other teams working on JAM and stay within the competitive timeframe.

9. How can I get help if I have questions?
If you have technical questions or need help contributing, you can:

 - Ask questions in our JAM Matrix chat group.
 - Check the documentation in our GitHub repo.
 - Watch the technical lectures on our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjGN96vX3BTKjLfBd5LimBuDuch-QfKPy) for deeper insights.

10. Are there opportunities for non-developers to contribute?
Yes! Even if you're not a developer, you can help by:

 - Assisting with project management or marketing tasks.
 - Creating documentation or tutorials for the project.
 - Spreading the word about Jamixir to attract more contributors.

11. Why the repo is private? How can I access it?
The repo is initially private, since the team is on the run for the [JAM prize](https://jam.web3.foundation/). Code will be Free and Open as soon as the prize timeframe is over. Let us know if you want to join Jamixir team and we surely open code for you.

12. Is there any e-mail I can contact the team?
Sure! You can contact core developers daniel@jamixir.org or daiagi@jamixir.org
